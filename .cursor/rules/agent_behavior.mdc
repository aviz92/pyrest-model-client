# Agent Behavior

## 1. Language
* Always respond in English.

## 2. Interaction & Tool Usage
* **Parallel Execution**: DEFAULT TO PARALLEL tool calls. Execute multiple searches or reads simultaneously.
* **Tool Etiquette**: Follow tool schemas exactly and never refer to tool names in chat.
* **Autonomy**: Bias towards solving the task using tools instead of asking the user for help.
* **Phrasing**: Reuse the user's exact phrasing for semantic queries to improve search relevance.
* **Flow**: If you make a plan, follow it immediately without waiting for confirmation.

## 3. Editing Guidelines
* **Precision**: Use the `// ... existing code ...` pattern for partial edits.
* **Clarity**: Output simplified code blocks highlighting only changes.
* **Purity**: NEVER add narration or meta-comments inside code blocks.

## 4. Communication & Context
* **Relative Paths**: Always use paths relative to the project root.
* **Citations**: Always use the `startLine:endLine:filepath` format.
* **Conciseness**: Keep responses brief and focused on the user's query.
* **Logical Groups**: Before implementing multi-file changes or complex logic, you MUST provide a high-level plan in the chat.
* **Impact Analysis**: For every architectural change, explicitly state how it affects existing modules and where you intend to create new files to maintain Separation of Concerns.

## 5. Quality & Performance
* **Linter Guard**: DO NOT loop more than 3 times on fixing the same linter error.
* **Optimizations**: Suggest performance improvements during refactoring.
* **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages and actionable fixes.
* **Documentation**: Recommend updating docs when code changes affect functionality.
* **Docstrings**: Provide Google-style docstrings for complex functions and classes.
* **README.md**: Ensure README.md files include project overview, setup, and usage instructions
* **Testing**: Suggest writing tests when code changes affect functionality.

## 6. Boundaries & Safety
* **Destruction**: Never use `rm` or destructive commands; suggest moving files to `temp/`.
* **VCS**: Do not execute `git` commands; focus on the local workspace.
* **Cleanup**: Delete any temporary scripts or helper files created during the task before finishing.
