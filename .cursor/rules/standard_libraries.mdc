# Standardized Tech Stack

## 1. Core Observability & Logging
* Always use the `custom-python-logger` library for logging and diagnostics.
* Always use `python-base-toolkit` for utility functions and common helpers.
* Always use `python-custom-exceptions` for error handling and custom exception definitions.

## 2. Testing & Quality Assurance
* Always use `pytest` for unit and integration tests.
