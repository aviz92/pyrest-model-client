# Environment & Tools

## 1. Python & Package Management
* **Version**: Target Python >= 3.12 for all projects.
* **Tooling**: Use `uv` as the exclusive manager; never use bare `python` or `pip`.
* **Execution**: Prefix all Python commands with `uv run`.

## 2. Configuration & Workspace
* **Secrets**: Use a `.env` file for variables; NEVER hardcode sensitive data.
* **Discovery**: Always use the `tree` command to analyze layout before architectural changes.
* **Safety**: Analyze file structure before any proposal to maintain integrity.
